### 🆔 Friendly Prefixed IDs for your Ruby on Rails models

[![Build Status](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/actions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids)

Generate prefixed IDs for your models with a friendly prefix. For example:

```ruby
user_12345abcd
acct_23lksjdg3
```

Inspired by [Stripe's prefixed IDs](https://stripe.com/docs/api) in their API.

## 🚀 Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prefixed_ids'
```

## 📝 Usage

Add `has_prefix_id :my_prefix` to your models to autogenerate prefixed IDs.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :user
end
```

This will generate a value like `user_1234abcd`.

To retrieve the prefix ID, simply call:

```ruby
User.to_param
```

Or `User.prefix_id` if to_param override is disabled.

To query using the prefixed ID, you can use either `find` or `find_by_prefix_id`:

```ruby
User.find("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe")
User.find_by_prefix_id("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe")
```

We also override `to_param` by default so it'll be used in URLs automatically.

To disable find and to_param overrides, simply pass in the options:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :user, override_find: false, override_param: false
end
```

### Generic lookup

Imagine you have a prefixed ID but you don't know which model it belongs to.

```ruby
PrefixedIds.find("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm3")
#=> #<User>
PrefixedIds.find("acct_2iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe")
#=> #<Account>
```

### Customizing

You can customize the prefix, length, and attribute name for PrefixedIds.

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :acct, minimum_length: 32, override_find: false, to_param: false
end
```
