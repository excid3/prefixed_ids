### üÜî Friendly Prefixed IDs for your Ruby on Rails models

[![Build Status](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/excid3/prefixed_ids/actions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prefixed_ids)

Generate prefixed IDs for your models with a friendly prefix. For example:

```ruby
user_12345abcd
acct_23lksjdg3
```

This gem works by hashing the record's original `:id` attribute using [`Hashids`](https://hashids.org/ruby/), which transforms numbers like 347 into a string like yr8. It uses the table's name and an optional additional salt to hash values, returning a string like `tablename_hashedvalue`.

Inspired by [Stripe's prefixed IDs](https://stripe.com/docs/api) in their API.

## üöÄ Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prefixed_ids'
```

## üìù Usage

Add `has_prefix_id :my_prefix` to your models to autogenerate prefixed IDs.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :user
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> Add `has_prefix_id` _before_ associations because it overrides `has_many` to include prefix ID helpers.

### Prefix ID Param

By default, Prefixed IDs overrides `to_param` in the model to use prefix IDs.

To get the prefix ID for a record:

```ruby
@user.to_param
#=> "user_12345abcd"
```

If `to_param` override is disabled:

```ruby
@user.prefix_id
#=> "user_12345abcd"
```

##### Query by Prefixed ID

By default, prefixed_ids overrides `find` and `to_param` to seamlessly URLs automatically.

```ruby
User.first.to_param
#=> "user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe"

User.find("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe")
#=> #<User>
```

> [!NOTE]
> `find` still finds records by primary key. For example, `User.find(1)` still works.

You can also use `find_by_prefix_id` or `find_by_prefix_id!` when the `find` override is disabled:

```ruby
User.find_by_prefix_id("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe") # Returns a User or nil
User.find_by_prefix_id!("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm32iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe") # Raises an exception if not found
```

To disable `find` and `to_param` overrides, pass the following options:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :user, override_find: false, override_param: false
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're aiming to masking primary key ID for security reasons, make sure to use `find_by_prefix_id` and [add a salt](#salt).

##### Salt

A salt is a secret value that makes it impossible to reverse engineer IDs. We recommend adding a salt to make your Prefix IDs unguessable.

###### Global Salt

```ruby
# config/initializers/prefixed_ids.rb
PrefixedIds.salt = "salt"
```

###### Per Model Salt

```ruby
class User
  has_prefix_id :user, salt: "usersalt"
end
```

### Find Any Model By Prefix ID

Imagine you have a prefixed ID but you don't know which model it belongs to:

```ruby
PrefixedIds.find("user_5vJjbzXq9KrLEMm3")
#=> #<User>

PrefixedIds.find("acct_2iAnOP0xGDYk6dpe")
#=> #<Account>
```

This works similarly to GlobalIDs.

### Customizing Prefix IDs

You can customize the prefix, length, and attribute name for PrefixedIds.

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_prefix_id :acct, minimum_length: 32, override_find: false, override_param: false, salt: "", fallback: false
end
```

By default, `find` will accept both Prefix IDs and regular IDs. Setting `fallback: false` will disable finding by regular IDs and will only allow Prefix IDs.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
